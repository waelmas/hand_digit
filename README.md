# hand_digit
Handwritten digit recognition based on MNIST dataset.

Install Anaconda
https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/

Create a tensorfow environment
https://www.anaconda.com/tensorflow-in-anaconda/


Install all requirements
> pip3 install -r requirements.txt

Use train.py for training based on the well known MNIST dataset of handwritten digits
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database

Use predict.py to test the model on a random image you will select from MNIST dataset
(Once the image is shown you will have to close it to show the predicted output)

The trained model included has an accuracy of approximately 99%

You can modify both train.py and predict.py according to your needs.
